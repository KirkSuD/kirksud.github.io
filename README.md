I'm KirkSuD, a CS student who is still learning lots of things.

Currently, this site only shares some HTML pages which worth trying.

## Shared HTMLs

Links to useful / fun html page:

* [[App] memo](https://kirksud.github.io/share/memo.html)

A responsive memo web app that saves memos in local storage
with backup & restore functionality  
using bootstrap, jquery, jquery-ui, material icons.  
You can organize your thoughts, plan your todos using the folder functionality.
Just try it!

* [[Game] 2048](https://kirksud.github.io/share/2048.html)

No need to explain! The classic 2048 game. It's responsive, of course.  
Play it on your laptop and mobile phones!

* [[Game] Don't touch the spikes!](https://kirksud.github.io/share/dtts.html)

Inspired by [mobile game - Don't Touch The Spikes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.donttouchthespikes&hl=zh_TW).  
Almost the same as the original game, but different skin - a cute squirrel & pine cone!  
Well... I'm lazy to implement a real collision algo.  
So, you know... You'll see something strange occasionally.  
But it's still really fun! I promise.

* [[Visualization] The knapsack 0-1 algorithm](https://kirksud.github.io/share/knapsack.html)

A visualization of knapsack 0-1 algorithm.  
You can toggle recursive & exact, 4 versions in total!
